funny . \\\\nit is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . \\\\nthe plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . \\\\nthe little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . \\\\nsadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . \\\\nthis feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . \\\\n ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) \\\\n , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\\\na film needs a plot . \\\\nit needs characters for empathy value . \\\\nit needs a story and an emotional center . \\\\nif a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . \\\\nkevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . \\\\nwith dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . \\\\npeter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . \\\\nbut getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . \\\\nhis remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . \\\\njay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . \\\\nhow funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . \\\\nfor me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . \\\\nthere was not enough cleverness or variety . \\\\nit is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . \\\\npenis jokes work only so many times . \\\\nshowing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . \\\\nthey were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . \\\\njay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . \\\\nas the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . \\\\nin jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . \\\\njay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . \\\\nthis leaves them at loose ends . \\\\nthey are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . \\\\nthey decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . \\\\nso it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . \\\\nthe film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood \\\\nthe problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . \\\\nsilent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . \\\\nthis makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . \\\\njay has to be the comic . \\\\nhe could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . \\\\nthe problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . \\\\nhe is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . \\\\nso jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . \\\\ntheir starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . \\\\nlike dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . \\\\ncertainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . \\\\nthey are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . \\\\nit is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . \\\\nthe film does not offer much to an adult audience . \\\\ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\\\n\\\"\",\n          \"b'the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and \\\" real \\\" movies . \\\\nconsider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . \\\\ntop-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . \\\\nbased on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story\\\\'s structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . \\\\ntold in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan\\\\'s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . \\\\nthe author is even on record as applauding egoyan\\\\'s changes . \\\\nin the press notes the book\\\\'s author describes the story as \\\" a parable of lost children . \\\" \\\\nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \\\\npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of \\\" the pied piper \\\" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \\\\nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\\\\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \\\\nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \\\\nthey and the rest of the town\\\\'s children come into harm\\\\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \\\\nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \\\\nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \\\\nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \\\\nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \\\\nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \\\\nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \\\\nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \\\\neach little aspect has its own fascination . \\\\nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \\\\nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \\\\nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\\\\'s numerous faults . \\\\nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \\\\none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \\\\nwell , single parent billy\\\\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \\\\nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \\\\nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\\\\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \\\\nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \\\\nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \\\\nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \\\\nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \\\\nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \\\\n ( \\\" i can help you , \\\" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \\\\n \\\" not unless you can raise the dead , \\\" billy snaps back . \\\\nmitchell\\\\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \\\\nmychael danna\\\\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \\\\nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \\\\nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \\\\nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \\\\ni could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \\\\nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \\\\neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \\\\nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \\\\nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \\\\nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . \\\\nmind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way . \\\\ni know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream\\\\'s . \\\\nas a result , it\\\\'s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it\\\\'s about thirty times smarter than it is . \\\\nbased on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top . \\\\nthe appropriate mood being set ( this is angst-horror for the 90\\\\'s ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town . \\\\nfrom there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly

james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five\\\\'s jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr . , respectively ) cheer her on . \\\\nafter getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to

, followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer , bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche ) , an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie . \\\\nall the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation . \\\\nnot that the movie was without pleasure . \\\\ncount the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun . \\\\nmostly , though , note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye-catching pair look . \\\\n'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
